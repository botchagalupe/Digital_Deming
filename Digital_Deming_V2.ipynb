Quality Assurance is a system of activities designed to ensure that the product or service that is delivered meets the customer's expectations.

This leads to improved product quality and customer satisfaction.\\n\\n## Increased Efficiency\\nSPC allows manufacturers to identify inefficiencies in their production process and make necessary adjustments. This leads to increased efficiency and cost savings.\\n\\n## Cost Savings\\nBy identifying and addressing potential problems early on, manufacturers can avoid costly rework and scrap. This leads to significant cost savings over time.\\n\\n# How SPC Works\\nSPC involves monitoring a process using statistical methods to identify any variation in the process. The goal is to identify any variation that is outside of the normal range and take corrective action before it results in defective products. \\n\\n## Control Charts\\nOne of the primary tools used in SPC is the control chart. A control chart is a graph that shows how a process is performing over time. It includes a centerline that represents the average value of the process and upper and lower control limits that represent the acceptable range of variation. \\n\\n## Data Collection\\nTo create a control chart, data must be collected on the process being monitored. This data is typically collected in real-time using sensors or other monitoring devices. \\n\\n## Statistical Analysis\\nOnce the data has been collected, it is analyzed using statistical methods to determine if the process is within the acceptable range of variation. If the process is outside of the acceptable range, corrective action is taken to bring it back into control. \\n\\n# Conclusion\\nStatistical process control is a powerful tool for manufacturers looking to improve their production processes and product quality.
